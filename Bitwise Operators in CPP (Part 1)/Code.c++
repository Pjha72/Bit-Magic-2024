// A Bitwise operator is an operator that manipulates the binary representation of numbers. This is the first part of the Bitwise Operators in C++ which introduces us to the first three bitwise operators, namely:

// AND (&) operator : 1 & 1 = 1 and rest all are 0
// OR (|) operator : 0 | 0 = 0 and rest all are 1
// XOR (^) operator : 0 ^ 0 = 0 and 1^1 = 0 and rest all are 1
